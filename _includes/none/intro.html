We are in the midst of a revolution in animal behavioral analysis that is being led by application of machine learning. This workshop will focus on the analysis of social behaviors using machine learning, and will consist of hybrid lecture and lab components. Drs. Golden and Kumar will present the principles of behavior annotation and introduce two behavior annotation and classification platforms that their lab has been developing. The anticipated result of the workshop is familiarity with the principles of behavior annotation and the ability to use two behavior annotation platforms. One of the goals of the workshop is to build a community of behaviorists and computational biologists who can support each other in this rapidly evolving field.
